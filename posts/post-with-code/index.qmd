### **Monitor Flex Express: Automated TV Advertising Data Processing Tool**

**Project Overview:**\
Monitor Flex Express is a Python-based application designed to automate the processing and analysis of TV advertising data. It streamlines the workflow for media monitoring by cleaning, categorizing, and generating detailed reports from raw Excel and HTML files. The tool integrates with Google Sheets for real-time data updates and provides customizable outputs for regional and client-specific insights.

**Key Features:**

-   **Data Processing:**

    -   Cleans and standardizes raw advertising data from multiple sources (Excel, HTML).

    -   Corrects mismatched client names, locations, and categories.

    -   Filters out irrelevant entries (e.g., radio, political campaigns).

-   **Automated Reporting:**

    -   Generates pivot tables and segmented reports by region (e.g., Curitiba, Maring√°).

    -   Calculates projected ad values with dynamic discounting logic.

    -   Distributes aggregated values evenly across unmatched records.

-   **Google Sheets Integration:**

    -   Pulls coverage and client data from Google Sheets for real-time validation.

    -   Uses `gspread` and Google API for seamless authentication.

-   **User-Friendly Interface:**

    -   Built with `PySimpleGUI` for an intuitive file selection and configuration panel.

    -   Disays real-time progress updates during processing.

**Technologies Used:**

-   **Python Libraries:**

    -   `pandas` for data manipulation.

    -   `openpyxl` for Excel file handling.

    -   `gspread` for Google Sheets integration.

    -   `PySimpleGUI` for the graphical interface.

-   **Concurrency:** ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel file loading.

-   **Error Handling:** Robust validation for file paths, data types, and edge cases.

**My Contributions:**

-   Designed the data pipeline to handle heterogeneous input formats (Excel, HTML).

-   Implemented dynamic discounting logic based on client, region, and ad type.

-   Developed a mapping system to reconcile mismatched client names across datasets.

-   Optimized performance with multithreading and memory-efficient operations.

**Impact:**

-   Reduced manual data processing time by **90%** for monthly reports.

-   Improved accuracy by automating error-prone categorization tasks.

-   Enabled regional teams to access tailored insights instantly.

**Code Repository:**\
`git clone https://github.com/Guiermis/MonitorFlexExpress.git`
