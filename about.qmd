I’m Guilherme, a Data Science undergraduate and Junior Data Analyst with hands-on experience in collecting and analyzing CRM and marketing data. My work spans across marketing and platform management, where I’ve applied my skills in SQL, Python, and data visualization to generate insights that inform decision-making and optimize performance.\
\
Since 2020, I’ve developed a strong foundation in data analysis, working with databases and programming to transform raw data into actionable insights. I'm continuously refining my expertise in data science, data analysis, and data engineering, with a focus on delivering impactful solutions that align with business goals.\
\
I’m always eager to learn and connect with professionals in data, technology, and analytics to collaborate on innovative projects. If you share a passion for leveraging data to solve complex problems, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas.
